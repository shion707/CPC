Required package:
circstat-matlab: https://github.com/circstat/circstat-matlab/blob/master/circ_vmpdf.m

This is a MATLAB code that was originally developed using Matlab 2022

Files: 
CPC_0623.m: 
The original CPC model. Each section simulates the learning curve of one Experiment and replicates the corresponding main figure in the paper.

ReCPC_0623.m: 
Simulation of the revised CPC model on Experiment 10. 

The expected run time of each code should be <10s.
