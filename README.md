# CPC: A cerebellar population coding model for sensorimotor learning
See https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.07.04.547720 for the description of the model.

Contact: tianhewang@berkeley.edu

Required package:

circstat-matlab: https://github.com/circstat/circstat-matlab/blob/master/circ_vmpdf.m

This is a MATLAB code that was original developed using Matlab 2022

Files: 
CPC_0623.m: The original CPC model 
Each section simulates the learning curve of one Experiment. And replicate the corresponding main figures in the paper.

ReCPC_0623.m: The original CPC model 
Simulation of the revised CPC model on Experiment 10. 

The expected run time of each code should be <10s.
